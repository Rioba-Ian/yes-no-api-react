# Playing around with the yes/no api

In this app, we return a simple response that gives an answer with a meme gif

## The yes/no api

The api returns an Object with answer(yes and no), a meme gif url

## Using react

I used react but even plain Js would do. I leveraged the virtual DOM of reactand the UseEffect hook to fetch data. I also used an await function so that we could call back the useEffect fetching the data. I also added a refresh but with a normal function to fetch the data again once the user clicks on the bbutton.

## Continued development

Honestly, this is just a narrow part of playing with an API which could be used to add user experience in other apps such as quiz games.
